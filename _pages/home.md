We are a research group at the [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.physics.leidenuniv.nl).  Our research focuses on foundations and tools for accountable data-driven systems. The goal is to ensure that data-driven systems that employ artificial intelligence and machine learning are not inscrutable black-boxes; rather their operation is explained in a form that enables trust in their operation and protection of societal values, including privacy and fairness.
